- brain stormed the new version of Snake game, new features to add to differentiate it from the basic version of the game
- cloned the project, resolved errors occurrin on local, and made it run
- read the reference documentation of greenfoot to understand its core functions and understand basic implementations

What am I planning to work on next?
- refactor code to make some core components follow observer design pattern - speed changes 
- add speed changes as the level progresses (Issue #12 - https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp22-202-team-m/issues/5)

What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- none

### Week 2

What tasks did I work on / complete?
- update speed as level progresses
- exploring how/if snake length increase on food consumption can be implemented using observer pattern

What am I planning to work on next?
- implementation for snake length 
- increment/Decrement number of lives of the snake using singleton/observer
