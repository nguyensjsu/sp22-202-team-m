### Week 1

What tasks did I work on / complete?
- brain stormed the new version of Snake game, new features to add to differentiate it from the basic version of the game
- cloned the project, resolved errors occurrin on local, and made it run
- read the reference documentation of greenfoot to understand its core functions and understand basic implementations

What am I planning to work on next?
- refactor code to make some core components follow observer design pattern - speed changes 
- add speed changes as the level progresses (Issue #12 - https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp22-202-team-m/issues/5)

What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- none

 XP Core Value
 ` Communication : Team co-ordinated on brainstorming the idea and discussing the design of the game both in-person and online video meetings

### Week 2

What tasks did I work on / complete?
- update speed as level progresses
- exploring how/if snake length increase on food consumption can be implemented using observer pattern

What am I planning to work on next?
- implementation for snake length 
- increment/Decrement number of lives of the snake using singleton/observer

What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- none

XP Core Value
- Feedback : Got feedback on the ongoing development task and possible improvements to it from other team members 


### Week 3

What tasks did I work on / complete?
- brainstormed how factory pattern could be used to create objects in Snake world
- created food factory to create food objects at runtime like apple & bananas
- created obstacle factory to create obstacle objects at runtime like fire and stone
- refactored and optimized the original boiler plate code
- added class diagrams for 3 major design patterns used in the project implementation  - state, observer & factory pattern
- updated the README.md 

What am I planning to work on next?
- work on project documentation, high level diagram
- work on project demo and user story tasks

What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- none

XP Core Value
- Simplicity : Tried to simplify a specific code feature implementation by using design pattern

### Week 4

What tasks did I work on / complete?
- design high level diagram
- help in formulating user story

What am I planning to work on next?
- Complete the project diagram
- Coordinate with teammmates for demo 

What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
- none

XP Core Value
- Simplicity : Developed documentation and visual representation of the developed game, simplifying it to end user
